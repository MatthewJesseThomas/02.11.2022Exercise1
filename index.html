                Introduction
Magic in ancient Greece and Rome has been studied keenly in the last four decades. Most of the modern interest in magic comes from the 1987 publication of the Greek ‘magic manual’ “Papyri.” Nevertheless, magic was an essential aspect of Greco-Roman religions and cultures. There is no wholesome definition for magic because this concept cannot be accommodated within the known sciences. The meaning of the term ‘magic’ can change depending on the underlying context. In the end, it becomes challenging to make a clear distinction between magic and religion in the ancient world. Ancient Egypt is often considered as the overall authority in magic culture. Historical studies reveal that magic has evolved in various aspects over time.

Consequently, the overview and consideration of magic in ancient cultures have changed from being dominated by commonplace rituals to scientific and philosophical status. It is often argued that magical practices predate Greek culture and its subsequent glory, but they were never regarded in high esteem. Historically, magic and its accompanying beliefs gained prominence in Greece after the era of Alexander the Great. Literary material in the subject of magic and magical powers indicate was primarily found in Egypt, but the Greek and Roman scholarship later revived ancient interest in the matter. Within the Greco-Roman cultures, magic was later to form an independent tradition.

Moreover, the Greco-Roman culture accommodated several magic antiquities strands, including Christian, Jewish, Greek, Roman, and Greco-Egyptian magic. These subgenres of magic often interact with each other to produce other forms of magic. This essay examines magic in antiquity, especially in reference to ancient Greek and Roman cultures.
